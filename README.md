### [JSL11] Agile Board - Kanban Task Management App

# Task Management System

This project aims to develop a task management system with features that facilitate easy task management and organization. Below are the key functionalities explained:

## Clicking an Individual Task for Details

This feature allows users to click on an individual task on the task board to view its details. Users can then make edits to the task if necessary, such as updating the title, description, or status.

## Opening the Task Edit Modal

When users add or edit tasks, this feature opens a modal window where users can input task information conveniently. This modal provides a user-friendly interface for editing task details.

## Updating the Task Title

Users can update the title of a task within the edit modal. This functionality allows users to change how the task title is displayed on the task board, helping to keep task information organized.

## Updating the Task Description

Within the edit modal, users have the option to update the task description. This feature enables users to provide more detailed information about the task, clarifying its scope and requirements.

## Updating the Task Status

Users can update the current status of a task (todo, doing, done) within the edit modal. This functionality allows users to track the progress of tasks and keep the task board up-to-date.

## Saving Task Changes

After making edits to a task, users can save the changes within the edit modal. This ensures that the updated task details are stored and displayed correctly on the task board.

## Updating the UI with Task Changes

Once changes are saved, the task board UI is updated immediately to reflect the changes made to the task. This real-time update enhances user experience by providing instant feedback on task modifications.

## Deleting a Task from the Edit Modal

If a task is no longer needed, users have the option to delete it directly from the edit modal. This feature streamlines task management by allowing users to remove unnecessary tasks efficiently.

## Canceling Edits Without Saving

Users can cancel their edits and close the edit modal without saving changes if needed. This functionality prevents accidental changes and gives users the flexibility to discard edits as desired.

## Editing Task Details

Users can edit the details of existing tasks within the edit modal. This feature enables users to correct errors or update information as needed, maintaining the accuracy of task data.

## Easy Navigation Between Task Statuses

Users can easily move tasks between statuses (todo, doing, done) to reflect their current progress. This feature simplifies task management by providing intuitive navigation options.

## Viewing Task Details

Users can view detailed information about a task to understand its scope and requirements fully. This feature enhances task visibility and facilitates effective communication among team members.
